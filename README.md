# advent-of-code
Links to Advent of Code solutions in Google Sheets.

I don't know any programming languages, but I use quite a lot of formulas in Excel/Google Sheets, so a few years ago I joined the engineers I worked with to try Advent of Code.  I try every day, though later on I sometimes can't complete the challenges.

In the sheets, I've truncated the input because the AoC creator requests people not share them - I'm hoping the truncated version is ok, because the sample often doesn't show all the criteria needed.
